# Usage

Save the FM3_assembly.FCMacro file into your Macro directory (e.g.: ~/.freecad/Macros) and restart FreeCAD.

Please adjust the path where the images are saved via "replace all" in the macro.

Prior to running the macro, please adjust the background color:
* Edit -> Preferences
* Display -> Colors
* Select "Single Color" (White) as background

# Important

In FM3, there are so few THT parts which are done in this rendering, so in
most cases it is easier to copy&paste the commands to the python console of FreeCAD:

* set visibility manually (steps are at the bottom of the Macro)
* set view
* set visibility & select elements for this step
* export jpeg
